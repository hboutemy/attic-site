  <p><a href="https://gora.apache.org/">Apache Gora</a>
     moved into the Attic in 2025-03.
     Apache Gora was an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://gora.apache.org/">https://gora.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Gora.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Gora
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
